# PlasmaDX-Clean RT Enhancements Guide

## Current State (Fixed)
âœ… **Overexposure Fixed** - Changes applied while agents were working:
- RT sphere radius: 25â†’5 units (matches visual particles)
- Attenuation: Proper quadratic `1/(1 + 0.1d + 0.01dÂ²)`
- Intensity: 50xâ†’2x multiplier
- Tone mapping: Reinhard operator in pixel shader
- Max distance: 500â†’100 units

## Available Enhancements

### 1. **Physical Plasma Emission** âœ… READY
Location: `shaders/particles/plasma_emission.hlsl`

Features:
- Accurate blackbody radiation based on Planck's law
- Shakura-Sunyaev disk temperature profile
- Doppler shifting for rotating particles
- Gravitational redshift near black hole
- H-alpha emission lines for hot plasma

Usage: Press **E** to toggle (runtime control added)

### 2. **ReSTIR (Spatiotemporal Importance Resampling)** ðŸš§ PLANNED
Benefits:
- 6-60x variance reduction in lighting
- Temporal accumulation across frames
- Spatial reuse from neighboring particles
- Perfect for sparse particle distributions

Implementation: See `/agent/AdvancedTechniqueWebSearches/IMPLEMENTATION_QUICKSTART.hlsl`

### 3. **Runtime Controls** âœ… IMPLEMENTED
New keyboard shortcuts:
- **I/K** - RT Intensity (Ã—2/Ã·2)
- **O/L** - RT Max Distance (Â±100)
- **E** - Toggle Physical Emission
- **R** - Toggle Doppler Shift
- **G** - Toggle Gravitational Redshift
- **Q** - Cycle RT Quality (Normal/ReSTIR/Adaptive)
- **T** - Temperature debug readback

### 4. **Future Enhancements** (from research)

#### Short Term (1-2 days each)
- **Particle SSAO**: Screen-space ambient occlusion adapted for particles
- **Temporal AA**: Reduce flickering at small particle sizes
- **HDR Bloom**: Emphasize hot particles with glow effect

#### Medium Term (3-5 days)
- **3D Gaussian Splatting**: Replace billboards with volumetric gaussians
- **Multiple Scattering**: Simulate light bouncing between particles
- **Adaptive LOD**: GPU-driven quality based on performance

#### Long Term (1-2 weeks)
- **Neural Denoising**: AI-based cleanup of noisy RT results
- **GPU Work Graphs**: Fully autonomous GPU scheduling (requires latest drivers)
- **Opacity Micromaps**: When DXR 1.2 releases (May 2025)

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. **Test current fixes** - Verify overexposure is resolved
2. **Try physical emission** - Press E to see blackbody colors
3. **Fine-tune intensity** - Use I/K keys to find sweet spot

### This Week
1. **Implement ReSTIR** - Major quality boost with minimal cost
2. **Add HDR bloom** - Make hot particles glow
3. **Temporal accumulation** - Reduce noise/flickering

### Performance Tips
- Current RT uses 4 rays/particle (medium quality)
- Press **S** to cycle between 2/4/8 rays
- Smaller particles (1-5 units) perform better than large (50+)
- RT distance of 100 units is good balance

## Technical Details

### Why Overexposure Happened
1. RT spheres were 5x larger than visual particles (25 vs 5 units)
2. Linear attenuation `1/(1+0.01d)` barely decreased with distance
3. 50x intensity multiplier was excessive
4. No tone mapping allowed values >1

### How It's Fixed
1. RT spheres match visual size (5 units)
2. Quadratic attenuation follows inverse-square law
3. 2x multiplier provides subtle enhancement
4. Reinhard tone mapping prevents blown highlights

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Particles still too bright at small sizes
**Solution**: Reduce intensity with K key or modify line 56 in `particle_billboard_ps.hlsl`:
```hlsl
color += rtLight * 0.3;  // Reduce from 0.5
```

### Issue: RT lighting coverage limited
**Solution**: Increase max distance with O key or particle radius in `RTLightingSystem_RayQuery.h`

### Issue: Flickering at distance
**Solution**: Implement temporal accumulation (ReSTIR) or increase particle size
