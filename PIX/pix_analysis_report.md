# PIX Capture Analysis Report for PlasmaDX Volume Rendering
Generated: 09/21/2025 04:42:45

## Summary
This report analyzes 4 PIX GPU captures to diagnose volume rendering visibility issues.

## Capture: off

## Capture: RayDir

## Capture: Bounds

## Capture: DensityProbe

## Key Diagnostic Questions for GPT-5

1. **Debug Mode Values**: Are g_debugMode values different in each capture (0,1,2,3)?
2. **Ray March Dispatch**: Is there a consistent ~(120,68,1) dispatch in all captures?
3. **Density Fill**: Is there a (16,16,16) dispatch before ray marching?
4. **Resource Barriers**: Any UAV/SRV transition warnings?
5. **Visual Similarity**: User reports Off mode looks identical to DensityProbe mode

## User-Reported Issue
- Seeing 'homogeneous colored fog' instead of coherent 3D volumetric shapes
- Previously had working blue 'mouth-like' volumetric shape
- Off mode (normal rendering) visually identical to DensityProbe mode (single sample)
- Using compute-only path with PLASMADX_DISABLE_DXR=1
