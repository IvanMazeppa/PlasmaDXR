I'm working on Branch 0.17.0 of PlasmaDX-Clean, a DirectX 12 volumetric rendering project with autonomous multi-agent system.

**Your task**: Fix 2 MCP server connection issues, then production test the autonomous agent.

**Context documents to read first**:
1. docs/CURRENT_STATE_SUMMARY_2025-11-16.md (project status)
2. docs/WINDOW_2_HANDOFF_MCP_FIXES.md (detailed instructions)
3. docs/VISION_REALIZATION_ROADMAP.md (architectural context)
4. https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agent-sdk/overview (Agent SDK specification)

**Summary**:
- Mission-control autonomous agent is working (agents/mission-control/autonomous_agent.py)
- 4/6 specialist MCP servers connected successfully
- 2/6 failing: log-analysis-rag and pix-debug (likely virtual env issues)
- Your job: Fix those 2 connections, then test autonomous agent on a real problem

**Tasks** (read WINDOW_2_HANDOFF_MCP_FIXES.md for details):
1. Fix log-analysis-rag connection (30 min)
2. Fix pix-debug connection (30 min)
3. Production test: Choose one real problem (probe grid brightness, DLSS-SR breakage, or Nov 2-4 visual regression)

**Success criteria**:
- 6/6 specialist MCP servers show "connected" in mission-control startup
- Autonomous agent completes production test workflow autonomously
- Agent coordinates 3+ tools and provides evidence-based recommendation

**Report back** to Window 1 (main session) with:
- Connection fix results
- Production test findings
- Any blockers encountered

**Important**: Don't modify mission-control autonomous agent - it's working correctly. Only fix specialist MCP server connections.
