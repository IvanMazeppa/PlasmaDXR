# Session Summary: Volumetric RT Particle Rendering Debug Session
**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Branch**: `cursor/remote-wsl` (working) | `0.2.2` (has partial working implementation)
**Status**: üî¥ Debugging runtime toggle system

---

## üéØ Original Goal

Improve the 3D Gaussian Splatting volumetric particle renderer with proper RT-based illumination instead of just color changes.

### User's Requirements:
1. ‚úÖ Better colors (fixed - now vibrant plasma colors)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è More spherical appearance at small sizes (partially working)
3. üî¥ RT engine as dominant light source (added but not working)
4. üî¥ Volumetric shadows from RT system (added but not working)
5. ‚ùå Physical emission system working in Gaussian mode (not implemented)

---

## üìä Progress Through Volumetric Roadmap

### ‚úÖ Completed (Working):
1. **ACES Tone Mapping** - Better HDR color preservation
2. **Black Background** - No more blue overexposure
3. **Improved Color Gamut** - Changed from brown to vibrant plasma tones
4. **Basic Volumetric Structure** - 3D Gaussian splatting working

### üü° Partially Working (Branch 0.2.2):
These features WORKED on first test (10-20 FPS with 20K particles):
1. **Shadow Rays** - Particle-to-particle occlusion
2. **In-Scattering** - Volumetric glow from nearby particles
3. **Phase Function** - Henyey-Greenstein forward scattering
4. **Beer-Lambert Absorption** - Physically correct volume rendering

**Evidence**: First test showed:
- FPS dropped from 127 ‚Üí 10-20 (proving expensive RT features were active)
- Colors improved dramatically
- 68M API rays, 206M hardware rays cast (PIX confirmed)

### üî¥ Currently Broken (Adding Runtime Toggles):
Attempting to add F5/F6/F7/F8 toggle keys broke everything:
- Features now have NO visual effect
- FPS stays at baseline (127fps) even with all toggles ON
- No performance impact when toggling features
- Debug visual indicators (colored corner squares) don't appear

## üêõ Root Cause Analysis

### The Bug:
**Root signature size mismatch** - Only allocates 48 DWORDs but struct needs 62+

#### Constant Buffer Layout:
```cpp
struct RenderConstants {
    XMFLOAT4X4 viewProj;              // 16 DWORDs
    XMFLOAT4X4 invViewProj;           // 16 DWORDs
    // Camera data                    // 24 DWORDs
    // Physical emission              //  6 DWORDs
    // RT toggles (NEW)               //  4 DWORDs
    Total: ~62 DWORDs
};
```

#### Root Signature (ParticleRenderer_Gaussian.cpp:124):
```cpp
rootParams[0].InitAsConstants(48, 0);  // ‚ö†Ô∏è TOO SMALL!
```

**Result**: The last 14 DWORDs (including RT toggles) are truncated/unread by GPU

### Fix Attempted:
Changed to `InitAsConstants(64, 0)` but **failed** - D3D12 root signature creation error.

**D3D12 Limit**: Root signature has a 64 DWORD total limit across ALL parameters, not per-parameter.

---

## üîß Solution Strategy

### Option 1: Use Constant Buffer (Recommended)
Instead of root constants, use a proper cbuffer:
```cpp
// Replace:
rootParams[0].InitAsConstants(48, 0);

// With:
rootParams[0].InitAsConstantBufferView(0);  // No size limit!
```

Then create and upload a constant buffer each frame.

### Option 2: Reduce Constant Size
Remove less-critical fields to fit in 48 DWORDs:
- Remove `padding` fields
- Combine toggles into bitflags
- Move rarely-changing data to separate buffer

### Option 3: Use Branch 0.2.2 as Base
The working implementation exists in branch `0.2.2`:
- Already has shadow rays, in-scattering, phase function working
- Just needs runtime toggle UI added on top
- Known to produce correct visual results

## üìÅ Modified Files This Session

### Shaders:
- `shaders/particles/particle_gaussian_raytrace.hlsl` - Added toggles, debug squares
- `shaders/particles/gaussian_common.hlsl` - Unchanged

### C++ Code:
- `src/particles/ParticleRenderer_Gaussian.h` - Added toggle fields to struct
- `src/particles/ParticleRenderer_Gaussian.cpp` - Modified root signature (BROKEN)
- `src/core/Application.h` - Added toggle member variables
- `src/core/Application.cpp` - Added F5-F8 key handlers, constant passing

### Current State of Code:
- ‚úÖ Constants being set correctly (verified in log: lines 98-101)
- ‚úÖ Shader compiled and loaded (12540 bytes)
- ‚úÖ F-key handlers working (responds to key presses)
- üî¥ Root signature TOO SMALL - constants truncated
- üî¥ Shader code not executing (no debug squares visible)

## üéÆ Runtime Controls (F5-F8)

### Implemented But Not Working:
| Key | Feature | Cost | Expected Visual |
|-----|---------|------|----------------|
| **F5** | Shadow Rays | ~50M rays | Red square top-left |
| **F6** | In-Scattering | ~20M rays | Green square top-right |
| **F7** | Phase Function | Free | Blue square bottom-left |
| **F8** | Phase Strength | Free | Adjust 0-20 |

### Debug Indicators Added:
```hlsl
// Top-left: Red if shadow rays ON
if (useShadowRays != 0 && pixelPos.x < 50 && pixelPos.y < 50)
    finalColor += float3(0.3, 0, 0);
```

**Status**: Not appearing (confirms shader constants not being read)

---

## üìã Next Steps (Priority Order)

### IMMEDIATE (Fix Initialization):
1. ‚úÖ Revert root signature to 48 DWORDs
2. ‚úÖ Rebuild to restore working state
3. Switch to **Option 1** (Constant Buffer View)

### SHORT TERM:
1. Replace root constants with CBV
2. Test debug squares appear
3. Verify toggle performance impact
4. Remove debug squares when confirmed working

### MEDIUM TERM:
1. Optimize shadow ray sampling (reduce from full BVH traversal)
2. Optimize in-scattering (reduce samples from 4 to 2)
3. Add adaptive quality (auto-disable on low FPS)

### LONG TERM (Original Roadmap):
1. Fix physical emission in Gaussian mode
2. Multi-bounce lighting (secondary rays)
3. ReSTIR integration for noise reduction
4. Temporal accumulation

## üî¨ Diagnostic Log Evidence

### What's Working:
```
[23:02:50] === DEBUG: Gaussian Constants ===
[23:02:50]   useShadowRays: 1        ‚úÖ Being set
[23:02:50]   useInScattering: 1      ‚úÖ Being set
[23:02:50]   usePhaseFunction: 1     ‚úÖ Being set
[23:02:50]   phaseStrength: 5.000000 ‚úÖ Being set
```

### What's Broken:
- FPS stays at 127 (should drop to ~20 with features ON)
- No colored debug squares visible
- Toggling F5/F6/F7 has zero effect
- Root signature creation fails at 64 DWORDs

---

## üíæ Safe Restore Points

### Branch 0.2.2:
- Has working shadow rays, in-scattering, phase function
- Missing: Runtime toggle UI
- Status: Committed and pushed

### Current Branch (cursor/remote-wsl):
- Has toggle UI implemented
- Missing: Working constant buffer binding
- Status: Uncommitted changes

### Recommended Recovery:
```bash
# Save current work
git stash

# Test branch 0.2.2
git checkout 0.2.2
# Run and verify it still works with the expensive features

# Return and apply fix
git checkout cursor/remote-wsl
git stash pop

# Apply Option 1 fix (CBV instead of root constants)
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Exact Fix Needed (Option 1 Implementation)

### Step 1: Change Root Signature (ParticleRenderer_Gaussian.cpp)
```cpp
// OLD (BROKEN):
rootParams[0].InitAsConstants(48, 0);

// NEW (FIX):
rootParams[0].InitAsConstantBufferView(0);  // b0
```

### Step 2: Create Constant Buffer
Add to ParticleRenderer_Gaussian.h:
```cpp
Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr<ID3D12Resource> m_constantBuffer;
```

### Step 3: Upload Constants Each Frame
In Render():
```cpp
// Upload constants to GPU
void* mappedData;
m_constantBuffer->Map(0, nullptr, &mappedData);
memcpy(mappedData, &constants, sizeof(RenderConstants));
m_constantBuffer->Unmap(0, nullptr);

// Bind to root signature
cmdList->SetComputeRootConstantBufferView(0, m_constantBuffer->GetGPUVirtualAddress());
```

This removes the 48 DWORD limit!

## üìû Agent Research Conducted

Two agents deployed to research volumetric RT techniques:

### Agent 1: rt-ml-technique-researcher-v2
**Deliverables**:
- Shadow ray implementation guide
- Volumetric scattering techniques
- ReSTIR integration docs
- Performance optimization strategies

### Agent 2: hlsl-volumetric-implementation-engineer-v2
**Deliverables**:
- Fixed shader code examples
- Proper illumination vs replacement
- Color pipeline fixes
- Working implementations in `/agent/` folder

**Key Finding**: RT lighting should illuminate particles, not replace their colors
```hlsl
// WRONG (old):
totalEmission = (emission * 0.3) + (rtLight * 2.0);

// RIGHT (new):
illumination = 1.0 + rtLight * 0.5;
totalEmission = emission * intensity * illumination;
```

## üìà Performance Targets

| Config | FPS | Rays/Frame | Quality |
|--------|-----|------------|---------|
| All OFF | 120+ | 0 | Baseline |
| Phase Only | 120+ | 0 | Good glow |
| Phase + InScatter | 60-80 | 20M | Better depth |
| All ON | 20-40 | 70M | Best quality |

**Current**: Stuck at 120+ FPS regardless of toggles (proves features not running)

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

When fixed, you should see:
1. ‚úÖ Red/green/blue debug squares in corners when features ON
2. ‚úÖ FPS drops dramatically when F5 or F6 enabled
3. ‚úÖ Phase function creates visible glow at high strength (F8)
4. ‚úÖ Toggling features has immediate visual + performance impact
