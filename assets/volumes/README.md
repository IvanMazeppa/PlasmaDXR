# Volumetric Assets (canonical)

This folder contains **repo-tracked volumetric example assets** used by PlasmaDX-Clean tooling and plugins.

## Subfolders

- `nanovdb_examples/`: Curated `.nvdb` example assets intended to load cleanly in PlasmaDX-Clean.

Notes:
- Large, intermediate bake outputs (OpenVDB sequences, `.blend` working files, renders) should go under `build/` or `assets/blender_projects/` (not here).
