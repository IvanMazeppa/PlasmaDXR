# NanoVDB Example Assets

This folder contains **small, curated `.nvdb` files** meant to be used as:
- plugin/sample content for the NanoVDB refactor
- sanity checks for file-loaded NanoVDB rendering

## Structure

- `GPT-5.2/`: Generated by GPT‑5.2 Blender scripts (Blender 5.0 → OpenVDB → NanoVDB).

## Conventions

- Prefer **single-grid** NanoVDBs (usually `density`) for predictable shader behavior.
- Prefer **FLOAT grids** (not FP16/quantized) unless the engine explicitly supports FP16 grids.
