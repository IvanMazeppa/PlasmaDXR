# Blender Docs (canonical)

This folder is the canonical home for **Blender workflow documentation** for the OpenVDB → NanoVDB asset pipeline.

## Layout

- `GPT-5.2/`: Docs authored/maintained by the GPT‑5.2 agent (recipes + CLI tooling + TDR guidance).
- `recipes/`: Shared recipe library (cross-author).
- `tooling/`: General workflow and debugging documentation.

## Notes

- The older `docs/blender_recipes/` tree may contain historical links; prefer `assets/` going forward.
