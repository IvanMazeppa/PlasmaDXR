# Blender Projects

This folder is reserved for **.blend project files** and Blender-side working directories.

Policy:
- Keep large binary files here (not under `docs/`).
- Prefer naming that includes the author/agent and the asset name (e.g. `GPT-5.2_SupergiantStar.blend`).
- Keep baked caches (OpenVDB sequences) alongside the project when possible for portability.
