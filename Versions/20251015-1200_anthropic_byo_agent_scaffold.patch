Agent: Anthropic BYO Agent Scaffold
==================================

Purpose
-------
Create a minimal, non-destructive BYO-Anthropic helper that lets us use Claude Sonnet models from the terminal within Cursor, while respecting the repo’s MCP guardrails and patch policy.

What’s included
---------------
- tools/anthropic_agent/agent.py — CLI that:
  - Reads recent repo docs (CLAUDE.md, NEXT_SESSION_START_HERE.md, etc.) for context
  - Adds guardrails-aware system prompt
  - Calls Anthropic with your API key
  - Writes a versioned patch note under Versions/ (YYYYMMDD-HHMM_slug.patch)
- tools/anthropic_agent/README.md — setup and usage
- tools/anthropic_agent/__init__.py — package marker

How to use
----------
1) Install dependency and set key:
   pip install anthropic
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

2) Run a prompt and write a patch note:
   cd tools/anthropic_agent
   python agent.py "propose blit pipeline edits for HDR->SDR path" \
     --model claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 \
     --slug blit_hdr_sdr

3) Preview only (no file write):
   python agent.py "summarize NEXT_SESSION tasks" --no-write

Notes
-----
- This tool does NOT apply code edits directly — it emits patch notes per project policy. Apply edits manually or via your chosen workflow.
- Swap models or providers by changing --model and relevant env vars. Works with Sonnet 3.5/4.5 (when available via API) or proxies.
- Keeps output concise and aligned with guardrails (no deletions/renames without APPROVE_DELETE token).

Verification
------------
- Lint clean for added files.
- Patch writing verified: creates timestamped file in Versions/.
